            <dd>This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.</dd>

            <dd>Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it. Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though this is also not the case.</dd>

		<div class="content">
			<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and due to its proximity it is not easily seen except during twilight. For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun. Thirteen times a century Mercury can be observed from the Earth passing across the face of the Sun in an event called a transit, the next will occur on the 9th May 2016.</p>

                <h3>A year on Mercury is just 88 days long.</h3>
One solar day (the time from noon to noon on the planet’s surface) on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km.

		<a class="close" href="#"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i></a>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and is the fifth planet out from the Sun. It is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined. It is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a “gas giant”.</p>
		   <h1>Facts about Jupiter</h1>
           <article>
            <h3>1.Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the solar system.
            </h3>
            <p>This was around the 7th or 8th century BC. Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods. To the Greeks, it represented Zeus, the god of thunder. The Mesopotamians saw Jupiter as the god Marduk and patron of the city of Babylon. Germanic tribes saw this planet as Donar, or Thor.</p>

            <h3>2.Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets.
</h3>    <p>It turns on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. The rapid rotation flattens the planet slightly, giving it an oblate shape.
</p>      <h3>3.Jupiter orbits the Sun once every 11.8 Earth years.
</h3>     <p>From our point of view on Earth, it appears to move slowly in the sky, taking months to move from one constellation to another.
</p>    <h3>4.Jupiter has unique cloud features.
</h3>   <p>The upper atmosphere of Jupiter is divided into cloud belts and zones. They are made primarily of ammonia crystals, sulfur, and mixtures of the two compounds.
</p>    <h3>5.The Great Red Spot is a huge storm on Jupiter.
</h3>  <p>It has raged for at least 350 years. It is so large that three Earths could fit inside it.

			<p>Best known for its fabulous ring system, Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in our solar system. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant and is composed of similar gasses including hydrogen, helium and methane.</p>
		   <h1>Facts about Saturn
        </h1>
        <article>
            <h3>1.Saturn is the most distant planet that can be seen with the naked eye.
            </h3><p>It is the fifth brightest object in the solar system and is also easily studied through binoculars or a small telescope.
            </p><h3>2.Saturn was known to the ancients, including the Babylonians and Far Eastern observers.
            </h3><p>It is named for the Roman god Saturnus, and was known to the Greeks as Cronus.
            </p><h3>3.Saturn is the flattest planet.
            </h3><p>Its polar diameter is 90% of its equatorial diameter, this is due to its low density and fast rotation. Saturn turns on its axis once every 10 hours and 34 minutes giving it the second-shortest day of any of the solar system’s planets.
            </p><h3>4.Saturn orbits the Sun once every 29.4 Earth years.
            </h3><p>Its slow movement against the backdrop of stars earned it the nickname of “Lubadsagush” from the ancient Assyrians. The name means “oldest of the old”.
            </p><h3>5.Saturn’s upper atmosphere is divided into bands of clouds.
            </h3><p>The top layers are mostly ammonia ice. Below them, the clouds are largely water ice. Below are layers of cold hydrogen and sulfur ice mixtures.
